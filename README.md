## ‚åõ Running Juka

Juka can be run in various ways depending on your system. Detailed instructions can be found in our documentation.

### Microsoft/Linux/MacOS/FreeBSD

On some systems you can just double click Juka and it will launch an interactive terminal (REPL).

If that doesn't work, open a Terminal/Power Shell/Command Prompt and navigate to the location of where Juka is located.

Once you are inside the directory, run the following command to start Juka in REPL mode:

```jsx
./juka
```

If you have a file with Juka code, you can run it with the following command (substitute HelloWorld.juk with your filename):

```jsx
./juka HelloWorld.juk
```

### Juka API

Juka comes with an API

Download JukaAPI at <https://jukalang.com/download>

We are using JukaApi for visitors to test their code online: <https://jukalang.com/tryonline>

Special thanks to mogenius for hosting our API:
<https://api.jukalang.com>

If you would like to help improve the api, feel free to deploy a container at:

[![Develop on Okteto](https://okteto.com/develop-okteto.svg)](https://cloud.okteto.com/deploy?repository=https://github.com/jukalang/juka&branch=master)

### Microsoft Azure Function

Upload the package to Azure Web Server
Use web deploy to publish Juka (Azure Function) to the cloud.

### Including in C# Project

Once you install Juka via NuGet: Install-Package JukaCompiler

You can pass your code as a string to Juka:

```jsx
new JukaCompiler.Compiler().Go(codeAsString, (isFile: false));
```

If you want to pass a filename instead of a string, you can run the following command

```jsx
new JukaCompiler.Compiler().Go(fileName, (isFile: true));
```

We welcome any contribution! Thank you so much for checking out Juka!
